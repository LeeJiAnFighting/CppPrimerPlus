/* ex.06.03.cpp
Write a precursor to a menu-driven program.The program should display 
a menu offering four choices, each labeled with a letter. If the user 
responds with a letter other than one of the four valid choices, the 
program should prompt the user to enter a valid response until the 
user complies.Then the program should use a switch to select a simple 
action based on the userâ€™s selection.A program run could look 
something like this:
Please enter one of the following choices:
c) carnivore p) pianist
t) tree g) game
f
Please enter a c, p, t, or g: q
Please enter a c, p, t, or g: t
A maple is a tree.
